# Poplatek Terminal Android SDK

This repo provides Android modules and sample applications for Poplatek
payment terminal Android SDK:

* **Source modules** can be integrated directly into your application, using
  the application's build system.  The source modules have minimal external
  dependencies beyond standard Android APIs to simplify integration.

* **Sample applications** can be built into .apk files.  The build files are
  part of this repo.  Sample applications provide examples and guidance in
  using the SDK APIs.  They can also be used as starting points for making
  custom applications.

## Sample applications

The SDK contains the following sample applications:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Application</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>TestNetworkProxy</td>
<td>Test application providing an automatically reconnecting, persistent
    Bluetooth RFCOMM connection with JSONPOS network proxying.</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Building sample applications

Sample applications (Android Studio projects) provide guidance in how the
APIs are used.  Open an application in Android Studio and build/run normally.

## Using library components in an app project

Library sources can be copied into an Android Studio directory source
directory to be included in the build.

You can also use an external directory (sibling or ancestor) by editing
build.gradle manually, see:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18947314/how-to-add-a-linked-source-folder-in-android-studio.
The TestNetworkProxy sample application uses this technique.

Permissions (see samples for exact details):

* Bluetooth requires:

  - `android.permission.BLUETOOTH`
  - `android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`
  - `android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`

* Network proxying requires:

  - `android.permission.INTERNET`
